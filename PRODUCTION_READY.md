## ✅ COMPLETED FIXES

### 1. Product Listing Bug (CRITICAL)
**Issue:** Products not appearing in category or main listings  
**Root Cause:** Boolean query parameters (isFeatured, isBestSeller) were always set to `false` when not provided, filtering out featured products  
**Fix:** Changed controller to only apply filters when explicitly provided  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed & Deployed

### 2. Product Detail Page Missing (CRITICAL)
**Issue:** 404 error on `/products/derma-facewash`

**Fix:** Created complete product detail page with:
- Image gallery with thumbnails
- Add to cart functionality
- Add to wishlist functionality
- Stock quantity display
- Discount pricing
- Related products
- Product details tabs
**Status:** ✅ Created & Deployed

### 3. Request Entity Too Large (CRITICAL)
**Issue:** Unable to add products with images - 413 error  
**Root Cause:** Default NestJS body size limit (100kb) too small for product data  
**Fix:** 
- Increased body size limit to 50MB in main.ts
- Updated ImageUploadField to upload images to backend separately
- Configured Vercel function timeout
**Status:** ✅ Fixed & Deployed

### 4. Product Image Storage
**Issue:** Images not displaying in product listings  
**Root Cause:** Images stored in wrong format (not using ProductImage collection)  
**Fix:** Updated admin service to create ProductImage documents when product is created  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

### 5. isNew Field Mapping
**Issue:** `isNew` parameter in DTO didn't map to `isNewProduct` in schema  
**Fix:** Added mapping in both create and update product methods  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed & Deployed

### 6. Phone Number Validation
**Issue:** Phone number was optional, allowing invalid data  
**Fix:** Made phone required with 10-digit numeric validation  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

### 7. OTP Countdown Timer
**Issue:** No visual indicator of OTP expiration time  
**Fix:** Added 2-minute countdown timer on OTP verification page  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

### 8. Superadmin Credentials Exposed
**Issue:** Superadmin login credentials visible on public login page  
**Fix:** Removed credentials display from login page  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

### 9. Nepal Address Form
**Issue:** Address form used free text instead of structured locations  
**Fix:** Implemented cascading dropdowns for Province/District/Municipality/Ward  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

---

## ⚠️ KNOWN MINOR ISSUES

### 1. User Registration DTO

**Impact:** Low - Frontend likely uses correct fields  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Fix Required:** Update registration DTO to accept either format

### 2. Delivery Settings Response
**Issue:** `valleyDeliveryCharge` returns `undefined` in test  
**Impact:** Low - Settings might not be configured yet
